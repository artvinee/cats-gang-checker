# cats-gang-checker (ISN'T WORKING RIGHT NOW)
CatsGang checker by artvine.

Everything is also compatible with software by https://github.com/Axcent-ape.

In config.py we write necessary delays and ref. code (it is better to keep mine).

Perhaps, as in dogs, a username is required. I have not tested it. Refs counts.

upd 26.07 also now doing tasks

Feedback is welcome
